# Capture-Recapture Simulations

Simulations for generating & Bayesian model for analysing capture-recapture data. Very much a work in progress.

The Stan model here is based on that by Hiroki Ito [in the Stan example models repo](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/blob/master/BPA/Ch.06/Mt.stan). It may be copyrighted by Ito or Kery and Schaub who described it in _Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS_ -- I am not sure. Otherwise consider everything in here to be under the BSD license.

Note that the repo is in a bit of a messy state but I can't be arsed to clean it up. Now I finally know why research code is usually so messy ...
